<p> Story: Portal 2 takes place in the events after Portal 1. The player, Chell, accidentally reawakens the main antagonist she thought she killed, GLaDOS, and is forced to continue her unfinished "testing" in the Aperture Science testing facility. As the sadistic AI takes back her control of the vast facility, Chell makes her way towards her by completing the testes she is given with the help of her new friend Wheatley.<br> After Chell and Wheatley reunite with GLaDOS, she attempts to kill Chell using the turrets but to her surprise, she finds out that Chell and Wheatley together replaced the turrets with defective ones. After her failure with the turrets she brings down a pipe into the chamber that Chell is held in and tries to use her famous poison gas, Neurotoxin. However, the only thing that came down was none other than Wheatley. Now with Wheatley there, Chell was able to switch who is in charge of the facility, and in this case, she switched GLaDOS with Wheatley. While Wheatley, being overwhelmed with power, he becomes corrupted and betrays Chell.<br> While he lectures Chell about how HE did all of the work he puts GLaDOS in a potato battery. GLaDOS, in her weak state, reveals that Wheatley is literally a moron. He was designed by the greatest minds of the generation working together for the purpose of creating the dumbest moron who ever lived. Infuriated, Wheatley punches both Chell and Wheatley down an elevator shaft, thus breaking it, sending the two free falling down to the depths of the facility.<br> At the end, GLaDOS and Chell work together to destroy Wheatley, who is stacked with bombs and shields all around him. After the two reflect the bombs back at him and place corrupted cores on him, GLaDOS is ready to be transferred back into her body. As Chell goes to press the button, Wheatley already planted bombs all over that room, and blows up the button. As Chell lies on the ground after the blast of the bombs, the roof breaks above her, revealing a full moon. While still having a portal placed under Wheatley, Chell shoots a portal onto the moon itself, sucking her and Wheatley in it.<br> Chell is holding onto Wheatley who is still connected onto GLaDOS’ body. GLaDOS flicks Wheatley off, sending him into the vast emptiness of space along with the “overly excited about space” Space Core, and grabs Chell, who then blacks out.<br> After waking up, GLaDOS apologizes to Chell for trying to kill her and sends her free out of the facility.   </p>
