<p> GLaDOS:In Portal 2, GLaDOS (Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System) is the main antagonist. She is an artificially intelligent computer system created by the Aperture Science workers long ago. After she was built, she was too smart and powerful and had intelligence dampening spheres placed on her, which only made her worse. She became corrupted and killed every person in the facility with her neurotoxin and everyone she didnâ€™t kill was tested. <br> After the events of Portal 1, she hated the player, Chell, from the bottom of her heart, however after Wheatley put GLaDOS in a potato battery and Chell saved her from a bird, she grew to like Chell.<br> After defeating Wheatley and putting GLaDOS back in charge, she grew to love Chell as if she was her own daughter and sent her free from the facility along with her companion cube.<br> GLaDOS has the mind of Caroline, the assistant of the founder of the Aperture Science Facility, Cave Johnson. Before Cave died, he wanted Caroline to be in charge of the facility and put her mind into an AI thus creating GLaDOS.<br> After GlaDOS&apos; realization that she is Caroline, she deleted her memory and personality and reverted back to her old self, The GLaDOS all of the players know and love.   </p>
