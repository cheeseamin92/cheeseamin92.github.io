<p> Wheatley: Wheatley is a new character that first appears as a protagonist in Portal 2. He helps the player throughout the first half of the game (right up until the part where the character switches GLaDOS with Wheatley to be in charge of the facility) as a guide to get to GLaDOS. <br> When Wheatley was in GLaDOS’ body and GLaDOS was in a potato battery, GLaDOS reveals to the player and to Wheatley himself that is purpose in being created was specifically be a moron. As GLaDOS said, “The engineers tried everything to make me behave, to slow me down. Once, they even attached an Intelligence Dampening Sphere on me. It clung to my brain like a tumor, generating an endless stream of terrible ideas.” “It was your voice.” “Yes, you’re the tumor. You’re not just a regular moron; you were designed to be a moron.” This was when Wheatley betrayed you. <br> “He’s not just a regular moron; he’s the product of the greatest minds of a generation working together with the express purpose the dumbest moron who ever lived.” This was the monologue GLaDOS spoke as she and Chell were falling down the elevator shaft. <br> After the credits of Portal 2, the players see Wheatley stranded in space apologizing to Chell and GLaDOS while the Space Core orbits him. </p>
